#Dungeon Delver

A quick, roguelike game where the main objective is to stay alive and delve as deep into the depths as possible

##How to Play

Get as far down in the earth as possible before your all light from your torch is extinguished. Collecting coal can provide additional fuel for your light-source, however be warned that utilizing bombs or using the jet-pack only further diminishes your rather limited supply. How far down can you get?

##Controls
Hover - Spacebar
Jump - Up Arrow
Move - Left/Right Arrows
Bomb - Down Arrow

##Scoring
Scores are based off of the following factors
* Depth Achieved
* Number of pickups aquired
* Number of times damage was taken
* Remaining Health
* Remaining Time

##How to Clone
* Perform the usual cloning procedure
* The game engine (Phaser) cannot be ran directly and requires a server
  * `npm start` - start the BrowserSync server
  * `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` - Python's quick server
  * Other options are fine too
